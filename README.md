# PlayFair Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains a PlayFair class that can be used to encrypt/decrypt messages using the PlayFair cipher.

## Future work

- Add ability to brute force PlayFair keys (either the keying material or the resulting tableau).
  This brute force attempt can use the PlayFair class to perform encryption/decryption of a chosen message,
  thus has access to both the original message and the ciphertext of its chosen
